# Neptune Hyprland Setup

This repository provides a customized setup for Hyprland, derived from [Hyprdots](https://github.com/prasanthrangan/hyprdots), tailored to a minimalistic approach and personal taste.

## Prerequisites

To replicate this setup, you will need:

- An Arch Linux or Arch-based distribution. Common Arch-based distros include:

  - Arch Linux
  - EndeavourOS (used for testing this setup)
  - Manjaro
  - ArcoLinux
  - etc.

- No desktop environment installed, as this setup assumes a minimal base.

- `yay` AUR helper installed to manage AUR packages.

## Installation Steps

1. Clone this repository using Git:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/loo-ee/neptune-hyprland.git ~/neptune
   ```

2. Navigate to the cloned directory:

   ```bash
   cd ~/neptune
   ```

3. Run the main setup script to initiate the configuration:

   ```bash
   ./main_script.sh
   ```

   This script will automate the installation and configuration process.

## Notes

- Ensure your system is up to date before running the setup script.
- Review the scripts and configurations in this repository to understand changes made from the original Hyprdots setup.
- Customize any configurations as per your preferences after installation.

## Credits

- This setup is based on the principles and configurations from [Hyprdots](https://github.com/prasanthrangan/hyprdots).
